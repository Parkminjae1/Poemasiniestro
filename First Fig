My candle burns at both ends;
It will not last the night
But ah, my foes, and oh, my friends
It gives a lovely light..

I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!
